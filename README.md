A bridge between **Webshare.cz** (premium account) and the ***arr stack** (Sonarr/Radarr). A single container that acts as:

- a **Newznab indexer** (`/torznab/api`) — translates Sonarr/Radarr queries into Webshare searches and returns the results as a release feed,
- a **SABnzbd download client** (`/sabnzbd/api`) — accepts a grab, downloads the file through your premium account into a folder, and lets *arr import it as usual.

## Getting started

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This pulls the prebuilt image `ghcr.io/janprochy/websharr` (tags: `latest`,
the version number, e.g. `0.3.11`). To build from source instead, uncomment
`build: .` in `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up -d --build`.

Then open **`http://localhost:9797/ui`** and walk through the first-run setup:
create your Websharr account and enter your Webshare.cz **premium** login
(just a username/e-mail and password — Webshare.cz has no API key). Websharr
generates its own API key for Sonarr/Radarr; you'll find it in **Settings**.

Environment variables (`.env`, all optional) can pre-fill the Webshare login
and pin the API key — values saved in the UI take precedence and persist in
`/config/settings.json`.

Set `DOWNLOADS_DIR` (in `.env`, or as a stack environment variable in Portainer)
to the same host folder that Sonarr/Radarr see as their download directory
(otherwise set up a Remote Path Mapping). `CONFIG_DIR` and `WEBSHARR_PORT` work
the same way; see `.env.example` for the defaults.

## Web UI

A monitoring and testing interface runs at **`http://localhost:9797/ui`**
(the bare domain redirects here; sign-in required, Sonarr-style):

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-settings.png" alt="Websharr settings screen with Osaka Jade theme, Webshare account status, API key controls and download settings" width="920">
</p>

- **Queue** — live progress with **pause / resume** and delete per download.
- **History** — completed/failed downloads with retry and clear.
- **Search** — manual search whose **Grab** button pushes a release through the
  same SABnzbd flow Sonarr uses; results show container, resolution and length.
  When a grabbed file has no `SxxEyy`/year in its name, a small form asks for the
  series/season/episode (or title/year) so the import parses.
- **Log** — live backend activity, including the Sonarr/Radarr HTTP requests, so
  you can watch the integration from the browser.
- **Help** — the flow diagram and the Sonarr/Radarr setup steps below, in-app.
- **Settings** — Webshare account, API key, password.

For TV searches Websharr normalizes release names to `Series SxxEyy - …` so
Sonarr can parse and import even the many CZ files that ship without `SxxEyy`
in the filename. Some manual imports are still occasionally needed.

## Setup in Sonarr / Radarr

### Indexer (Settings → Indexers → Add → Newznab, Custom)

Add it as **Newznab**, not Torznab. Newznab is the usenet protocol, so Sonarr/Radarr
route grabs to the paired SABnzbd download client below. A Torznab indexer is treated
as torrent and its grabs would be sent to a torrent client instead.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| URL | `http://websharr:9797/torznab` |
| API Path | `/api` |
| API Key | copy from Websharr → Settings |
| Categories | 5000 (TV) / 2000 (Movies) |

### Download client (Settings → Download Clients → Add → SABnzbd)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | `websharr` |
| Port | `9797` |
| URL Base | `/sabnzbd` |
| API Key | copy from Websharr → Settings |
| Category | `tv` (Sonarr) / `movies` (Radarr) |

Running a second Sonarr/Radarr instance (e.g. a kids library)? Give it its own
category — add it under Websharr → Settings → Downloads (or `CATEGORIES`) and it
downloads into its own `<complete>/<category>` folder.

Host names like `websharr` work when everything shares a Docker network; otherwise
use the LAN IP and port. Also works through **Prowlarr** — add it there as a
**Generic Newznab** indexer (same URL/API path/key) and let Prowlarr sync it to
Sonarr/Radarr; the SABnzbd download client is still added directly in each *arr.

## Good to know

- **Shared download folder.** Websharr and Sonarr/Radarr must see the *same*
  finished-download folder, or import can't find the files. Mount the same host
  path into all of them, or set a Remote Path Mapping in *arr. Websharr reports
  paths under its `COMPLETE_DIR`.
- **Czech content and quality profiles.** Many CZ releases have no resolution in
  the filename; Websharr reads the real height from Webshare and labels them
  (`1080p`, …) so quality is detected. But a profile that blocks non-English
  (e.g. a *Not English* custom format) will still reject Czech releases — allow
  Czech (or use a dedicated profile) if you grab CZ content.
- Watch the **Log** tab to see the *arr requests arrive in real time.

## Czech titles (TMDB)

Sonarr/Radarr search by the title they know — usually the English one — but
Webshare files are almost always named in Czech (`bez.vedomi…`, not
`the.sleepers…`), so those searches find nothing. Websharr bridges that gap by
looking the request up in **TMDB**:

- Paste a **TMDB API Read Access Token** (v4 auth, from your themoviedb.org
  account) into **Settings → Czech titles (TMDB)**, or pre-fill it with the
  `TMDB_TOKEN` environment variable (the UI value wins).
- For each query Websharr finds the title in TMDB and searches Webshare under its
  **original title** (`original_name` / `original_title`) — that's where the
  Czech name of a Czech show lives — while keeping the canonical title for the
  release name so *arr shows and imports it correctly (e.g. it grabs `Bez
  vědomí` but reports `The Sleepers`). ID-based lookups are tried first, then a
  name match.
- For foreign titles Websharr additionally searches the **Czech alternative
  titles** from TMDB — the name a Czech dub is filed under (e.g. `Kačeří
  příběhy` for *DuckTales*), which is not the original title.
- **Search aliases** (Settings) are a manual override: map a title to the exact
  Webshare name yourself for the cases where TMDB has no Czech title or picks the
  wrong match.

The token is optional — without it, aliases still work and everything else runs
as normal; you just lose the automatic Czech-title resolution.

With the token, ID-based searches (what Sonarr/Radarr send via Prowlarr) also
**check each file's duration** against the TMDB runtime of the movie or episode
and drop files far off it — an hour-long documentary that happens to start with
a short show's Czech name, a 20-minute special named like the feature, a
5-minute excerpt. Extended cuts (up to 1.6×) and double episodes (up to 2.6×)
still pass; files of unknown length are kept.

## Measured quality

Webshare's `file_info` is a media probe, so Websharr measures every shown file
(cached, with a process-wide limit and retry — Webshare answers 403 to bursts)
and writes what it measured into the release title, in tokens Sonarr/Radarr's
parser and custom formats already understand:

- **Resolution** — a claim that measures lower (`4K`/`UHD`/`2160p`, or a `1080p`
  with 720p inside) is replaced by the real height; 4:3 (1440×1080) and cropped
  widescreen (1920×800) still count as 1080p.
- **Codec** `x264`/`x265` and the **best audio track** (`DDP5.1`, `DD5.1`,
  `DTS-HD MA 7.1`, `TrueHD 7.1`, `AAC2.0`…; the CZ/SK track when the file has
  one) — only when the name carries none; the uploader's own tags win.
- **`Upscaled`** for 2160p below ~30 MB/min (TRaSH's `Upscaled` custom format
  already scores it).
- The `language` attribute lists **every tagged audio language**
  (`Czech, English` for a dual-audio file), and the `tmdbid`/`imdb`/`tvdbid` of
  the search are echoed so a Czech-only file name still maps to the right title.
- Stubs under 3 MB/min are dropped.
- **Movie titles Radarr can map:** a Czech-only file name Radarr can't parse
  (`Asterix a Obelix I. (1999)`, `Coco.mkv`) gets `<TMDB title> <year> - ` in
  front, so Radarr maps it by title and imports it by itself (a release it can
  only map by the echoed id is blocked from automatic import). Not when the name
  already starts with title + year, nor when what follows the title hints at
  another film (a sequel marker, or several words that aren't tags, genres or the
  film's other names — e.g. a cast list).

HDR/DV, bit depth, subtitles and the source (WEB/BluRay) are not in the probe
and are never invented.

### Release tags (optional)

With **Settings → Release tags** (or `RELEASE_TAGS=1`) Websharr adds its own
tags too. They mean nothing to Sonarr/Radarr on their own — they are for custom
formats you score in your profiles:

| Tag | Meaning | Suggested score |
|---|---|---|
| `CZaudio` / `SKaudio` | an audio track is tagged Czech / Slovak — a verified dub | + (e.g. 500 / 300) |
| `CZunverified` | the name claims a dub, but the tagged tracks don't show it (tags are sometimes rewritten, so not a hard reject) | − (e.g. −1000) |
| `LowBitrate` | 1080p below 20 MB/min (x264) / 14 (HEVC), 720p below 12 / 8 — a starved encode | − (e.g. −500) |

A custom format to import (Settings → Custom Formats → Import), one per tag:

```json
{
  "name": "Websharr: CZ audio",
  "includeCustomFormatWhenRenaming": false,
  "specifications": [
    {
      "name": "CZaudio",
      "implementation": "ReleaseTitleSpecification",
      "negate": false,
      "required": true,
      "fields": { "value": "\\bCZaudio\\b" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## HellSpy (optional second source)

[HellSpy](https://hellspy.to) is a free Czech video host — no account needed.
Enable it in **Settings → HellSpy** (or `HELLSPY_ENABLED=1`) and add it in
Prowlarr as a **second Generic Newznab** indexer: URL `http://websharr:9797`,
API Path `/hellspy/api`, the same API key. Being its own indexer, it gets its own
priority and tags; grabs go to the same SABnzbd download client. While disabled,
`/hellspy/api` answers with a Newznab error (910).

The search, filters, TMDB title/runtime checks and duplicate merging are the
Webshare ones. HellSpy only offers transcodes besides the original, so Websharr
always downloads the **original upload** and measures it with **ffprobe** (in
the image; it reads only the file headers): resolution, video codec, duration and
every audio track's codec, channels and language — the same data as Webshare's
probe, so the same title tokens and language attrs. Not known: HDR/DV, bit depth
and the source, as on Webshare; HellSpy's search has no file extension (the
download takes it from the link), no votes and no password flag. A probe takes
about a second (three at a time), so a new search is slower the first time;
results are cached per file.

HellSpy's [terms](https://hellspy.to/terms-and-conditions) forbid overloading the
service with automated requests, so Websharr caches searches and caps parallel
API calls and probes.

## Monitoring and notifications

- **Health check.** `GET /health` (no API key) returns `200` when the download
  folders are writable and the Webshare account is logged in with an active VIP,
  and `503` with a short reason per check otherwise — the image's Docker
  `HEALTHCHECK` and Uptime Kuma can use it as is. It reads the account status the
  app already refreshes hourly, so polling it never calls Webshare; right after
  start the Webshare check reports `pending` until the first refresh finishes.
- **Free disk space.** The SABnzbd `fullstatus` call reports real free/total
  space of the download folders, so Sonarr/Radarr can warn when they fill up.
- **Dashboard widget.** `GET /stats?apikey=…` returns compact JSON (active/queued
  counts, speed, failed count, Webshare VIP days) for a Homepage `customapi`
  widget or similar.
- **Prometheus.** `GET /metrics?apikey=…` exposes gauges
  (`websharr_queue_downloading`, `websharr_download_speed_bytes`,
  `websharr_history_failed`, `websharr_vip_days`, …) for Grafana.
- **Notifications.** Add [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) URLs
  (Discord, Telegram, ntfy, Slack, Gotify, …) in **Settings → Notifications** or
  via `NOTIFY_URLS`. Websharr alerts on a failed download, when Webshare is
  unreachable, and when your VIP is about to expire (threshold `NOTIFY_VIP_DAYS`).

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBSHARE_USERNAME` / `WEBSHARE_PASSWORD` | — | Webshare.cz credentials (initial default; editable in the UI) |
| `WEBSHARR_API_KEY` | auto-generated | API key for the Newznab/SABnzbd endpoints; set to pin a fixed value |
| `TMDB_TOKEN` | — | TMDB API Read Access Token for [Czech-title](#czech-titles-tmdb) lookups (UI value wins) |
| `NOTIFY_URLS` | — | Apprise URLs (comma-separated) for failure/VIP notifications (UI value wins) |
| `NOTIFY_VIP_DAYS` | `7` | Warn when Webshare VIP has this many days left or fewer |
| `SETTINGS_FILE` | `/config/settings.json` | persisted settings (UI account, Webshare login, API key) |
| `COMPLETE_DIR` | `/downloads/complete` | finished downloads (`<cat>/<name>/file`) |
| `INCOMPLETE_DIR` | `/downloads/incomplete` | in-progress files |
| `STATE_FILE` | `/config/state.json` | queue/history persistence |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` | `2` | concurrent downloads |
| `CATEGORIES` | `tv,movies` | SABnzbd categories offered to *arr, each with its own `COMPLETE_DIR/<cat>` folder (UI value wins) |
| `SEARCH_LIMIT` | `60` | max results from Webshare per query |
| `SEARCH_CACHE_TTL` | `600` | seconds an identical Webshare search is answered from memory; `0` disables |
| `RELEASE_TAGS` | off | add Websharr's own release tags (`CZaudio`, `CZunverified`, `LowBitrate`…); also in Settings |
| `HELLSPY_ENABLED` | off | serve [HellSpy](#hellspy-optional-second-source) at `/hellspy/api`; also in Settings |

Sonarr and Radarr repeat the same searches (per episode, per season, on retry),
so Websharr answers an identical Webshare search from memory for
`SEARCH_CACHE_TTL` seconds — faster, and kinder to Webshare's rate limits.

## How search results are cleaned up

Webshare's fulltext is loose (OR-based) and matches on any token, so raw results
are noisy. For a TV query Websharr:

- tries `S01E05`, `1x05` and a bare `05` (common for CZ uploads) variants;
- keeps only files whose name **starts with the show title** (drops unrelated
  files that merely contain a shared word or the episode number);
- keeps only the **requested episode** (read from the file name), so a search
  for E05 doesn't return E01–E08;
- ranks by relevance, and labels quality from the real video resolution.

Even so, because matching is filename-based, the occasional odd result slips
through — use Interactive Search / the UI when it does.

The same file is often uploaded to Webshare several times under different names.
Files of 50 MB and more with exactly the same size and extension are merged into
one release, and up to five identical copies ride
along with the grab: when the chosen file's link is dead ("File temporarily
unavailable"), Websharr downloads an identical copy instead of failing. It never
switches copies once part of the file is on disk. The copy shown is picked by
name and ident, never by votes, so the release keeps the same guid and publish
date across searches and a blocklisted one stays blocklisted.

## Limitations

- Webshare searches **by file names only** — no metadata; result quality depends
  on how files are named. When *arr sends a TVDB/IMDb/TMDB ID directly, Websharr
  resolves it through TMDB (see [Czech titles](#czech-titles-tmdb)); note that
  Prowlarr converts IDs to a text query before forwarding, so behind Prowlarr the
  ID is unavailable and the TMDB name match is used instead.
- Interrupted downloads (restart, network outage, or **pause**) resume where they
  left off via an HTTP Range request; a failed job can be restarted via SABnzbd
  `mode=retry` (Retry in the UI History).
